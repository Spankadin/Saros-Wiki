The wish, granted with a mysterious benevolence, whisked them away from their familiar realm of Mystara to an entirely uncharted continent \u2014 a pristine land they christened \u201cSaros\u201d. This new territory unfolded as a tapestry of richness, brimming with wonders, beauty, magic, and peril. Since their arrival, Saros has become the backdrop for countless fantastical tales, shared in hushed tones around campfires and echoing through the halls of hearths across the known world.</p> <p>Whispers carried on the wind tell of a clandestine cult known simply as \u201cThe Prism\u201d, sworn to ancient draconic rites, and veiled in secrecy. This enigmatic order is believed to harbor an insatiable desire for the power encapsulated within a Multi-Chromatic Dragon\u2019s egg. Legend tells that such an egg possesses the potential to birth a dragon of unparalleled majesty, a force capable of shaping the fate of Saros: by granting the first to be seen by a newborn Multi-Chromatic Dragon\u2026 a wish!</p> <p>At the heart of Saros stands Pyrris, the capital, with The Radiant White Citadel soaring into the clouds, vigilant over the waters of Bishop\u2019s Bay. For epochs, The Citadel was under the rule of the Elven Queen Amara. However, over the last few months, an enigmatic shift occurred \u2014 the queen, once an ever direct presence in her kingdom, ceased personal interactions and began communicating solely through written decrees. Rumors wildly circulate, suggesting that she might have fallen ill, or that a coup occurred and she is imprisoned within the tower by The Council \u2026maybe kidnapped by The Prism, or an even graver fate\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Almost everywhere outside of civilization is very ancient and dangerous.
