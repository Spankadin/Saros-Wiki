They greet with a sort of handshake by grabbing each other\u2019s right arm near the elbow.</p>","tags":["Faction"]},{"location":"Peoples%20%26%20Factions/The%20Black%20Circle/NPCs/Clarissa/","title":"Clarissa","text":"<p>A young female mage clad in dark traveler\u2019s robes with blond hair and an unassuming smile.
