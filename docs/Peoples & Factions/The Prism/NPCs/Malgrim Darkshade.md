The right hand of [Silas Voss](./Silas%20Voss.md) and second in command of [_about_](../_about_.md) dragon cult. Malgrim is a tall and fair female Elf cloaked in all black and hooded to obscure her pale white hair and milk-white eyes. Her loyalty to Silas is a means to an end... she constantly seeks opportunities to expand her influence, seize control, and surpass her master and unravel the secrets of the forbidden esoteric magics.
