The right hand of [[./Silas Voss|Silas Voss]] and second in command of [[../index|The Prism]] dragon cult. Malgrim is a tall and fair female Elf cloaked in all black and hooded to obscure her pale white hair and milk-white eyes. Her loyalty to Silas is a means to an end... she constantly seeks opportunities to expand her influence, seize control, and surpass her master and unravel the secrets of the forbidden esoteric magics.
