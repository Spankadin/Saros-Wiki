The Prism is a draconic cult lead by madman [Silas Voss](Silas%20Voss.md) and his right hand [Malgrim Darkshade](Malgrim%20Darkshade.md). The cult seeks the egg of a Multi-Chromatic Dragon, for they believe the old [Sarosian](../History%20&%20Lore/A%20Brief%20Saros%20History.md) legend that the first to be seen by a newborn Multi-Chromatic Dragon will be granted a wish of the most powerful magnitude.
