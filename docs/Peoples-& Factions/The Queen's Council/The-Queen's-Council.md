A cabal of five of the most powerful influencers in all of [Saros](../../History-&%20Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History.md). Currently ruling the realm on behalf of [Queen Amara](../../Maps-&%20Geography/Cities%20&%20Towns/Pyrris/NPCs/Queen-Amara.md) from [The Radiant Citadel](../../Maps-&%20Geography/Cities%20&%20Towns/Pyrris/Locations/The-Radiant-Citadel.md) in [Pyrris](../../Maps-&%20Geography/Cities%20&%20Towns/Pyrris/Pyrris.md). Some believe them to be behind her disappearance, while others praise them for keeping the realm afloat through such troubling times. While the former may be running on speculation, the latter are hoping flattery saves them from the [Stonepeak](../../Maps-&%20Geography/Cities%20&%20Towns/Pyrris/Locations/Stonepeak.md) stockades.
