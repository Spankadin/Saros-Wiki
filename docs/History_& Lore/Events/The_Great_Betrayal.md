After [[./The_Wandering|The Wandering]] when the first clans began to settle into their own territories, The [[../../Factions_& Clans/Dwarven Clans/Khaz'armok|Khaz'armok]] and [[../../Factions_& Clans/Dwarven Clans/Khaz'dar|Khaz'dar]] lords, once great friends, became sworn enemies. The discovery of the finest gem to have ever been seen in [[../A_Brief_Saros_History|Saros]] caused a great rift and blood feud between them, and they waged a massive war to decide which clan would possess it, but both failed in the end, as it was stolen.
