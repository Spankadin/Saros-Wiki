Loosely connected magical streams that seem to flow between one another and converge at specific points all across Saros. Where any lines meet there forms great places of magical energy that the elves use for creating and maintaining life, and the [[../../Factions_& Clans/Dwarven_Clans|Dwarves]] use for the great [[./Leystone|Leystone]] found at the convergences.
