[[The Toad|The Toad]] is a two-story half-timber and brick building with smooth stone floors and a warm breeze from the massive blazing fireplace that invites the weary traveler inside on a cold evening. Filled with elf-wrought tables and chairs, It was once a massive mansion that fell to ruin with age and was bought and restored by [[./Perla Mudridge|Perla]]. The main hall houses a large collection of priceless artwork from all across [[A Brief Saros History|Saros]]. Accommodations range from small, modestly priced rooms with a soft woolen mattress, to huge luxury suites that rival small houses.

The owner and innkeeper of the Toad is a tall female halfling named [[./Perla Mudridge|Perla]]. She was once an adventurer, but was maimed by a dragon and lost her left leg. She loves details and rumors, and she's often seen sitting at a table sharing tall drinks and even taller tales with adventurers that come into the Toad.

The inn's manager is a stocky female halfling named [[./Gerdga|Gerdga]]. She has a heavy smoker's cough, a dry sarcastic wit, and she insists on inspecting every coin paid to her. Anything you need can either be found behind her bar or by her hard working crew. 

The Toad is protected by a bound water elemental named [[./Hob|Hob]].
Lommen and Hommen are gnome twins who work at The Toad.
