A centuries old Snake-Man Wizard... Xiximanter was left in his laboratory by [[./The-Serpent-King|The Serpent King]] to work on his time experiments, and unbeknownst to himself, succeeded. When he was found by a party of adventurers, it so happened that what seemed like a few days to him was actually hundreds of years in [[../A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]]. While he worked, his civilization crumbled around him and his once great culture has been left to history.

He currently lives in the [[../../Maps-& Geography/Dungeons/Tomb-of-The-Serpent-King|Tomb of The Serpent King]] and is very friendly to most bipeds, usually willing to talk and negotiate deals if anyone seeks his knowledge of time manipulation. He absolutely HATES goblins and will become enraged at the sight of one unbound.
