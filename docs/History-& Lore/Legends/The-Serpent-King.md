A once great ruler of the northern [[../../Maps-& Geography/Cities & Towns/Goslow/Goslow|Goslow]] region, the Serpent King was besieged on all sides from many enemies. He was a fair and generous ruler who spent most of his resources trying to obtain immortality. He tasked his court wizard [[./Xiximanter|Xiximanter]] with discovering the fountain of youth, but died long before the wizard's experiments concluded.
