A powerful human wizard from Mystara who, in desperation, used "contact higher plane" to try and reach ANY being to free his people, and in doing so, ended up striking a deal with Bahamut. He gave up his immortality in exchange for transportation to "safety" where his people could live on, free from the vortex created by [Silas Voss](../../Factions-&%20Clans/The%20Prism/NPCs/Silas-Voss.md).
