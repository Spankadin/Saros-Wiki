[[./Korth|Korth]] serves as Head Priest of Torm at the temple. He is a very old and wise human paladin with large white eyebrows that hide his small eyes. Fairly narcoleptic and seems to always be asleep, however locals tell of a time when he was a mighty warrior who rallied the town to victory against a massive orc raiding horde.

[[./Ostalda|Ostalda]] is the resident sage that lives in a small room attached to the library inside of the temple. She is a half-elf with dark hair and bluing skin from years of divining with sacred mushrooms.
