The majestic capital of [Saros](../../../History-&%20Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History.md), Pyrris perches atop a colossal cliffside, overlooking the sprawling expanse of the kingdom. Home to the illustrious [The Radiant Citadel](./Locations/The-Radiant-Citadel.md), the city pulses with life, and its streets teem with a large traveler contingency seeking counsel and aid from the [Queen](./NPCs/Queen-Amara.md). The only road leading up the cliffs to Pyriss comes from [Goslow](../Goslow/Goslow.md).
