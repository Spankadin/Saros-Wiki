The majestic capital of [[../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]], Pyrris perches atop a colossal cliffside, overlooking the sprawling expanse of the kingdom. Home to the illustrious [[./Locations/The-Radiant-Citadel|The Radiant Citadel]], the city pulses with life, and its streets teem with a large traveler contingency seeking counsel and aid from the [[./NPCs/Queen-Amara|Queen]]. The only road leading up the cliffs to Pyriss comes from [[../Goslow/Goslow|Goslow]].
