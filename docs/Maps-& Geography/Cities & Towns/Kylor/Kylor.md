A coastal bay village delicately poised on the ocean's edge. Dominated by the art of fishing and boatsmithing, the city resonates with the rhythmic pulse of the sea. Kylor boasts a strong [Legion](../../../Peoples-&%20Factions/The%20Aegis%20Legion/The-Aegis-Legion.md) presence, ensuring the safety of its shores from the threat of outsiders, but a danger to those who dare disobey any legion's random whim.
