[[The-Toad|The Toad]] is a two-story half-timber and brick building with smooth stone floors and a warm breeze from the massive blazing fireplace that invites the weary traveler inside on a cold evening. Filled with elf-wrought tables and chairs, It was once a massive mansion that fell to ruin with age and was bought and restored by [[../NPCs/Perla-Mudridge|Perla]]. The main hall houses a large collection of priceless artwork from all across [[../../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]]. Accommodations range from small, modestly priced rooms with a soft woolen mattress, to huge luxury suites that rival small houses.

The owner and innkeeper of the Toad is a tall female halfling named [[../NPCs/Perla-Mudridge|Perla]]. She was once an adventurer, but was maimed by a dragon and lost her left leg. She loves details and rumors, and she's often seen sitting at a table sharing tall drinks and even taller tales with adventurers that come into the Toad.

The inn's manager is a stocky female halfling named [[../NPCs/Gerdga|Gerdga]]. She has a heavy smoker's cough, a dry sarcastic wit, and she insists on inspecting every coin paid to her. Anything you need can either be found behind her bar or by her hard working crew. 

**Employees:**
[[../NPCs/Hob|Hob]] - Bound water elemental who works as bouncer and cleaner.
Lommen and Hommen - gnome twins given a job by Perla after they were rescued.
[[../NPCs/Munchies-Muldridge|Munchies Muldridge]] - Nephew of Gerdga and general clumsy fool.
