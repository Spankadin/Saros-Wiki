A very small penguin who was rescued and healed by [[./Mori|Mori]] after finding him alone, lost, and hurt in Bishop's Bay several years ago. Chibs wears a small magical frost rune pendant Mori made for him to keep his body chilly and he leaves small little puddles behind where he walks that melt away quickly.
