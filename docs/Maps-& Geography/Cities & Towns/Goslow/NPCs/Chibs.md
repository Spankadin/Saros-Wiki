A very small penguin who was rescued and healed by [[./Mori|Mori]] after finding him alone, lost, and hurt in [[../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's-Bay|Bishop's Bay]] several years ago. Now residing in The [[../Locations/The-Sphinx's-Spellbook|The Sphinx's Spellbook]], Chibs wears a small magical frost rune pendant Mori made for him to keep his body chilly and he leaves small little puddles behind where he walks that melt away quickly.
