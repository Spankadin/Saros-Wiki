Jarvis Aucien is a tall, blonde, and muscular Half-Elf who operates [[../Locations/The-Bulkhead|The Bulkhead]] in [[../Goslow|Goslow]], a family rope and ship making business that has been passed down the Aucien line for generations. The Bulkhead is where anyone seeking the finest sea-faring vessels in all of Saros go, with hopes that they have enough coin and that Jarvis' services aren't booked out more than a few months. There is also quite the ropemaking operation as well, situated right on the docks. The actual [[../Locations/Aucien-Shipyard|Aucien Shipyard]] is just outside the gates of Goslow on the coast of [[../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's-Bay|Bishop's Bay]] to the north.
