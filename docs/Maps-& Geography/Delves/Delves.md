Long ago in the 2nd [[../../History-& Lore/Ages-of-Saros|Age]] when magical knowledge was crude at best, the [[../../Peoples-& Factions/Dwarven Clans/Dwarven-Clans|Dwarves]] and Elves worked together to harness the powers emanating from the earth at specific points known as [[../../History-& Lore/Legends/Fey-Lines|Fey-Lines]]. These fey-lines were loosely connected magical streams that seemed to flow between one another and converge at specific points all across [[../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]]. Where any lines met there would form great places of magical energy.

The elves used this magical power to spread life and abundance upon the lands, to keep their realms hidden from unknown dangers and eventually other races as their distrust grew. The dwarves used their great knowledge of architecture and geometry to set up massive "[[Delves|Delves]]" to both mine the Sarosian soil for the wonderous gems and "[[../../History-& Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]]", and to set up remote bases of operations for each mountain-home's ruling clan.

Many of these "delves" are now lost to time and ruin, likely occupied by denizens of the deeps that the dwarves unleased by digging too greedily. Once a delve inevitably goes too deep it is sealed, yet there is rumor of great untold treasure and magic to be uncovered by any who happen to discover these once majestic dwarven structures hidden underground, should they make it back to see the suns again.

There are a few delves in Saros whose locations are known, and even one delve that has caused an entire town to spring up around it. Once a delve has been re-found, it isn't long before adventurers of all types come seeking gold and glory, which usually sees traders and merchant-types follow along to pick up the scraps.
