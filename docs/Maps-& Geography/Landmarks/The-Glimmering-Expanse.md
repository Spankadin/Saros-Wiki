The vast central region of [[../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]] that is largely uninhabitable due to the harsh conditions presented. Rumored to have been created in the 1st [[../../History-& Lore/Ages-of-Saros|Age]] during a great dragon war, the Expanse is mostly desert and sand, with shards of glass littering the landscape, sometimes culminating in massive crystalline glass formations jutting out from the ground. The wind blows at such a speed that it stirs up clouds of sand-glass and tears apart anything not well prepared for the assault.

The only connection between northern and southern Saros is the land-bridge that spans the expanse over a great canyon known as [[./The-Wyrm-Scar|The Wyrm Scar]]. The Wyrm Scar cuts through the entire continent, splitting the two hemispheres apart almost entirely and uniting the two major waters of [[./Waters/The-Sea-of-Myth|The Sea of Myth]] and [[./Waters/The-Sparkling-Sea|The Sparkling Sea]]. Passage over the land-bridge is thought to be impossible since the disappearance of the [[../../Peoples-& Factions/Dwarven Clans/Khaz'armok|Khaz'armok]], who at one time were the inhabitants and guides through The Expanse.
