A massive river canyon that cuts through the entire continent of [[../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]], splitting the two hemispheres apart almost entirely and uniting the two major waters of [[./Waters/The-Sea-of-Myth|The Sea of Myth]] and [[./Waters/The-Sparkling-Sea|The Sparkling Sea]]. Passage through the Scar is treacherous but not impossible, as it takes patience and skillful navigation to get around the glass and rock that litters the canyon.

Many believe the Wyrm Scar and [[./The-Glimmering-Expanse|The Glimmering Expanse]] were created in the 1st [[../../History-& Lore/Ages-of-Saros|Age]] during a great dragon war.
