A powerful human wizard from Mystara who, in desperation, used "contact higher plane" to try and reach ANY being to free his people, and in doing so, ended up striking a deal with Bahamut. He gave up his immortality in exchange for transportation to "safety" where his people could live on, free from the vortex created by [[../../Peoples & Factions/The Prism/NPCs/Silas Voss|Silas Voss]].
