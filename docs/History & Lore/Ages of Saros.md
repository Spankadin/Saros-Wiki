- **1st Age (The First Breaths)**
	No actual historical record. Simply regarded as myth. Dragons ruled the lands before other beings came into existence, and it is believed that there was a great war that shaped much of the central region of Saros, namely "[[The Glimmering Expanse|The Glimmering Expanse]]" and "[[The Wyrm Scar|The Wyrm Scar]]".

- **2nd Age (The Great Tribulation)**
	 Magic was a mystery to the first humanoid beings to awaken on Saros. Mistrust and betrayals among early tribes of men caused massive wars leading to the beginning and end of factions like the [[The Storm Knights|The Storm Knights]] and the creation of the "[[The Urmong Barrows|Urmong Barrows]]". With the discovery of the magic of the [[Fey-Lines|Fey-Lines]], the Elves took to cultivating the soil and disappeared into the forests, while the Dwarves struck the earth and maintained their stonework kingdoms throughout their "[[Delves|Delves]]".

- **3rd Age (Caelum's Arrival)**
	 [[Caelum|Caelum's]] wish brought nearly 5000 Mystarans to Saros. Their technology, agriculture, warfare, and general way of living introduced massive changes to the geopolitical and cultural landscape due to being such a more advanced peoples than the native Sarosians. This disparity between the old and new inhabitants drove the Elves to secret woodland domains, while the dwarves have all but disappeared due to wars, diaspora, clan-fighting, and the immense danger that comes along with delving the depths of the underworld.

- **4th Age (Current Day)**
	[[Queen Amara|Queen Amara]] has ruled over Saros for the last 800 years since Caelum's death, but she has recently been missing and a great unrest is stirring across the land. [[The Queen's Council|The Council]] are overseeing Saros in Amara's stead.
