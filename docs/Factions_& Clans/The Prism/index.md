The Prism is a draconic cult lead by madman [Silas Voss](./NPCs/Silas_Voss.md) and his right hand [Malgrim Darkshade](./NPCs/Malgrim_Darkshade.md). The cult seeks the egg of a Multi-Chromatic Dragon, for they believe the old [Sarosian](../../History_&%20Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History.md) legend that the first to be seen by a newborn Multi-Chromatic Dragon will be granted a wish of the most powerful magnitude.
