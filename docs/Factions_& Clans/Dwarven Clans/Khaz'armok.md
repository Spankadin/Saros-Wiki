The Sand [[../Dwarven_Clans|Dwarves]], split from the [[./Khaz'dar|Khaz'dar]] after [[../../History_& Lore/Events/The_Great_Betrayal|The Great Betrayal]], taking to [[../../Locations_& NPCs/Landmarks/The_Glimmering_Expanse|The Glimmering Expanse]] to seek out untold riches. Some still believe them to still be in the deserts though none know for sure, as they stopped communications and trade with other peoples of [[../../History_& Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History|Saros]] centuries ago.
