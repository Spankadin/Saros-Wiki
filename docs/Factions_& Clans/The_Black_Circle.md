The Black Circle is a faction of mercenaries that formed in the beginning of the 3rd [Age](../History_&%20Lore/Ages_of_Saros.md). Their ideals are centered around autonomy and individual freedoms, vowing to serve under no one ruler. There is no "Head of the Black Circle", it is a loosely connected web of small chapterhouses and roaming bands. Due to their nature, they are in direct conflict with [The Aegis Legion](./The_Aegis_Legion.md) and are often vying for the sympathies of the average [Sarosian](../History_&%20Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History.md). Most adventurers come out of, or have to try to get through the Black Circle at one time or anotherâ€¦

Unless formed in large numbers for a show of strength by coin, members of the Black Circle tend to blend in to normal crowds. Their attire is often dark and suited for life in the strange wilderness of Saros. Members are only truly identified by a small black circle tattoo on the inner forearm that each must bear upon joining. They greet with a sort of handshake by grabbing each other's right arm near the elbow.
