The owner of [[../Locations/The-Sphinx's-Spellbook|The Sphinx's Spellbook]] is a short female Half-Elf named Mori; a timid but extremely intelligent young woman with purple hair and alchemical tattoos all over her visible skin - except her face which is almost free of ink. Mori lives above the shop on the 2nd story with her pet penguin [[./Chibs|Chibs]], who she rescued and healed after finding him alone, lost, and hurt in [[../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's-Bay|Bishop's Bay]] several years ago.
