Manager of [[../Locations/The-Toad|The Toad]]. Always seen with a pipe in one hand and her magnifying glass in the other. She is a short hobbit with a deep raspy voice and a horrible smoker's cough. Gerdga's best friend is [[./Perla-Mudridge|Perla Mudridge]], the owner of The Toad. Her sarcastic and dry wit is rarely matched in all of [[../../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]]. She insists on inspecting every coin coming into The Toad to make sure of it's authenticity.
