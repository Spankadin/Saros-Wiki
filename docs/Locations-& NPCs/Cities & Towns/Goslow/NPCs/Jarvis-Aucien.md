Jarvis Aucien is a tall, blonde, and muscular Half-Elf who operates [The Bulkhead](../Locations/The-Bulkhead.md) in [Goslow](../Goslow.md), a family rope and ship making business that has been passed down the Aucien line for generations. The Bulkhead is where anyone seeking the finest sea-faring vessels in all of Saros go, with hopes that they have enough coin and that Jarvis' services aren't booked out more than a few months. There is also quite the ropemaking operation as well, situated right on the docks. The actual [Aucien Shipyard](../Locations/Aucien-Shipyard.md) is just outside the gates of Goslow on the coast of [Bishop's Bay](../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's-Bay.md) to the north.
