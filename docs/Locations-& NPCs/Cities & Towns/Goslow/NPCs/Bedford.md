Overseeing the forge is a massive man simply known as Bedford. He has a loud booming voice, a shiny bald head, and a large grey mustache. He and his wife Mary love visitors and is always cheerful. His leather overalls are covered in soot and burn marks and his hands are like chiseled steel from decades of dedicated smith-work. Though very bulky and freakishly strong, he is also a proficient artist who adorns his creations with delicate and detailed inlays. He is one of the few in [[../../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]] capable of forging [[../../../../History-& Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]].
