Overseeing [[../Locations/Bedford's-Forge|Bedford's Forge]] is a massive man simply known as Bedford. He has a loud booming voice, a shiny bald head, and a large grey mustache. He and his wife [[./Mary|Mary]] love visitors and they are always cheerful. His leather overalls are covered in soot and burn marks and his hands are like chiseled steel from decades of dedicated smith-work. Though very bulky and freakishly strong, he is also a proficient artist who adorns his creations with delicate and detailed inlays. He is one of the few beings in all of [[../../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]] capable of forging [[../../../../History-& Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]].
