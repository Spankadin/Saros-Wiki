Overseen by [[../NPCs/Lone-Wolf-Louie|Lone-Wolf Louie]], [[The-Silver-Drake|The Silver Drake]] is one of the most famous [[../../../../Factions-& Clans/Gambler's Guild/index|Gambler's Guild]] halls in all of [[../../../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]], 2nd only to the massive hall in [[Rore|Rore]]. The Silver Drake is a tightly ran and well secured building where the foolhardy come from all over Saros to test their luck and their coin with hopes of leaving [[../index|Goslow]] as rich as [[../../Pyrris/NPCs/Lord-Goldhaven|Lord Goldhaven]] himself!
