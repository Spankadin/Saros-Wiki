A shimmering white tower, raising into the clouds, resting on the edge of the high [Pyrris](../Pyrris.md) cliffs that fall straight into the deep waters of [Bishop's Bay](../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's-Bay.md). Surrounded by a great wall patrolled by [The Aegis Legion](../../../../Factions-&%20Clans/The%20Aegis%20Legion/The-Aegis-Legion.md), the Citadel is heavily fortified and secure from all invasion forces from without. Home to [Queen Amara](../NPCs/Queen-Amara.md) and the main seat of power in [Saros](../../../../History-&%20Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History.md).
