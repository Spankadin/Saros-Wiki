Sworn sword of [[./Admiral-Thainan|Admiral Thainan]], guard and Lieutenant of [[../../../../Factions-& Clans/The Aegis Legion/index|The Aegis Legion]], and Second in Command at [[../index|Grymswatch]]. Festin is not nearly as mean spirited as his counterpart. Many wish he was in command, as he garners more respect and camaraderie from his troops than Thainan ever could.
