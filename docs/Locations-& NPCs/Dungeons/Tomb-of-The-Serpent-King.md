A once prosperous and esteemed underground city of Snake-men led by the fearless [[../../History-& Lore/Legends/The-Serpent-King|Serpent King]]. Now fallen to age and ruin... home to [[../../History-& Lore/Legends/Xiximanter|Xiximanter]], goblins, and blue mushrooms. Located a few miles north of [[../Cities & Towns/Goslow/index|Goslow]].
