The majestic capital of [Saros](../../../History_&%20Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History.md), Pyrris perches atop a colossal cliffside, overlooking the sprawling expanse of the kingdom. Home to the illustrious [Radiant Citadel](./Locations/The_Radiant_Citadel.md), the city pulses with life, and its streets teem with a large traveler contingency seeking counsel and aid from the [Queen](./NPCs/Queen_Amara.md). The only way to Pyrris is the [High Road](../../Landmarks/Roads/The_High_Road.md) from [Goslow](../Goslow/Goslow.md).
