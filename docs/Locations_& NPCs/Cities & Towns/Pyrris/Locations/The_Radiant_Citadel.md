A shimmering white tower, raising into the clouds, resting on the edge of the high [[../Pyrris|Pyrris]] cliffs that fall straight into the deep waters of [[../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's_Bay|Bishop's Bay]]. Surrounded by a great wall patrolled by [[../../../../Factions_& Clans/The Aegis Legion/The_Aegis_Legion|The Aegis Legion]], the Citadel is heavily fortified and secure from all invasion forces from without. Home to [[../NPCs/Queen_Amara|Queen Amara]] and the main seat of power in [[../../../../History_& Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History|Saros]].
