Mary is a sweet lady with a small-town charm not often felt in busy, bustling [[../../Goslow|Goslow]]. Mary's hobbies include raising butterflies, beekeeping, and spending most days sitting in the shade playing cards, gossiping with friends, reading "The Fine Point" gazette and drinking lemonade while her husband [[./Bedford|Bedford]] works the anvil. She dreams of one day being able to draw from the "Deck of Many Things".
