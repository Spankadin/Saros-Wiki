The owner and innkeeper of [[../Locations/The_Toad|The Toad]], a tall female halfling named Perla. She was once an adventurer, but was maimed by a dragon and lost her left leg. Perla's best friend is [[./Gerdga|Gerdga]] who also happens to manage The Toad, and she employs and watches over her inept nephew Munchil "[[./Munchies_Muldridge|Munchies]]" Muldridge. She loves details, and she's often seen sitting at a table drinking and eagerly sharing tales with adventurers that come into The Toad (with her [[../../../../History_& Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]] leg propped up on the table).
