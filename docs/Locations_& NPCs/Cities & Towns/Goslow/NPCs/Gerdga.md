Manager of [[../Locations/The_Toad|The Toad]]. Always seen with a pipe in one hand and her magnifying glass in the other. She is a short halfling with a deep raspy voice and a horrible smoker's cough. Gerdga's best friend is [[./Perla_Mudridge|Perla Mudridge]], the owner of The Toad. Gerdga's sarcastic and dry wit is rarely matched in all of [[../../../../History_& Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History|Saros]]. She insists on inspecting every coin coming into The Toad to make sure of it's authenticity.
