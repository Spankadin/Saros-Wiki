Overseen by [[../NPCs/Lone-Wolf_Louie|Lone-Wolf Louie]], [[The_Silver_Drake|The Silver Drake]] is one of the most famous [[../../../../Factions_& Clans/Gambler's_Guild|Gambler's Guild]] halls in all of [[../../../../History_& Lore/A_Brief_Saros_History|Saros]], 2nd only to the massive hall in [[Rore|Rore]]. The Silver Drake is a tightly ran and well secured building where the foolhardy come from all over Saros to test their luck and their coin with hopes of leaving [[../../Goslow|Goslow]] as rich as [[../../Pyrris/NPCs/Lord_Goldhaven|Lord Goldhaven]] himself!
