Sworn sword of [[./Admiral_Thainan|Admiral Thainan]], guard and Lieutenant of [[../../../../Factions_& Clans/The_Aegis_Legion|The Aegis Legion]], and Second in Command at [[../../Grymswatch|Grymswatch]]. Festin is not nearly as mean spirited as his counterpart. Many wish he was in command, as he garners more respect and camaraderie from his troops than Thainan ever could.
