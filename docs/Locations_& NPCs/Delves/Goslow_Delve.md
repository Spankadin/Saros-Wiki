Recently re-discovered and unsealed by an unknown source, a dwarf at [[../Cities & Towns/Goslow/Locations/The_Toad|The Toad]] has been leading adventurers into the cave entrance to the [[./index|Delve]] under the assumption that his original party is all but lost down there. 

A party of adventurers thwarted [[../../Factions_& Clans/The Prism/index|The Prism]]'s attempt to open the 2nd level of the delve that was sealed by magic centuries ago.
