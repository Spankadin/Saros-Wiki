Recently re-discovered and unsealed by an unknown source, a dwarf at [[../Cities & Towns/Goslow/Locations/The Toad (Tavern and Inn)|The Toad]] has been leading adventurers into the cave entrance to the delve under the assumption that his original party is all but lost down there. 

A party of adventurers thwarted [[The Prism|The Prism]]'s attemp to open the 2nd level of the delve that was sealed by magic centuries ago.
