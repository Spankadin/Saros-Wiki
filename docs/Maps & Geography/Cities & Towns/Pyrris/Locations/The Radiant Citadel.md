A shimmering white tower, raising into the clouds, resting on the edge of the high [_about_](../_about_.md) cliffs that fall straight into the deep waters of [Bishop's Bay](../../../Landmarks/Waters/Bishop's%20Bay.md). Surrounded by a great wall patrolled by [_about_](../../../../Peoples%20&%20Factions/The%20Aegis%20Legion/_about_.md), the Citadel is heavily fortified and secure from all invasion forces from without. Home to [Queen Amara](../NPCs/Queen%20Amara.md) and the main seat of power in [Saros](../../../../History%20&%20Lore/A%20Brief%20Saros%20History.md).
