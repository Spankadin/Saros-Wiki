A shimmering white tower, raising into the clouds, resting on the edge of the high [[../index|Pyrris]] cliffs that fall straight into the deep waters of [[Bishop's Bay|Bishop's Bay]]. Surrounded by a great wall patrolled by [[../../../../Peoples & Factions/The Aegis Legion/index|The Aegis Legion]], the Citadel is heavily fortified and secure from all invasion forces from without. Home to [[../NPCs/Queen Amara|Queen Amara]] and the main seat of power in [[Saros|Saros]].
