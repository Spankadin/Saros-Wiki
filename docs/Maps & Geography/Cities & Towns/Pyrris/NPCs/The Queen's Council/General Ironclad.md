General Roland Ironclad

Role: Supreme Commander of the Military

   - An imposing figure with a close-cropped beard and a weathered face, General Roland wears his military regalia with pride. His eyes, however, betray a keen intelligence, and his firm handshake belies a strategic mind.

   - *Responsibility:* Strategizing and overseeing the kingdom's defense, commanding the military forces, and ensuring the realm's security.
