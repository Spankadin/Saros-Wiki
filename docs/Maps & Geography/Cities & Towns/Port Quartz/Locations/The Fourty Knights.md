The Knights is the largest tavern and inn available in [Port Quartz](../Port%20Quartz.md). Ran by [Prance Mondrel](../NPCs/Prance%20Mondrel.md), this inn has quite a few rooms to spare, though they're not well kept. Thoughtful service and hospitality are in short supply at The Knight, as there are far too many travelers and far too much coin being passed around to take anything else into consideration.
