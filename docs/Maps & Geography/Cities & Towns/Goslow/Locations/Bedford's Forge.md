Known for the finest craftsmanship this side of Vy'Tungavor, [[../NPCs/Bedford and Mary|Bedford's]] forge is the local smithy where you can get anything you desire made if you are willing to both pay the high price, and wait patiently on the list behind high-priority clientele.

Overseeing the forge is a massive man simply known as [[../NPCs/Bedford and Mary|Bedford]].
