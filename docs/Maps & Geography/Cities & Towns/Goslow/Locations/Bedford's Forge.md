Known for the finest craftsmanship this side of [Vy'Tungavor](../../../Landmarks/Mountains/Vy'Tungavor.md), [Bedford's](../NPCs/Bedford%20and%20Mary.md) forge is the local smithy where you can get anything you desire made if you are willing to both pay the high price, and wait patiently on the list behind high-priority clientele.

Overseeing the forge is a massive man simply known as [Bedford](../NPCs/Bedford%20and%20Mary.md), one of the few known beings in [Saros](../../../../History%20&%20Lore/A%20Brief%20Saros%20History.md) capable of working [Leystone](../../../../History%20&%20Lore/Legends/Leystone.md) into useable weapons and armor.
