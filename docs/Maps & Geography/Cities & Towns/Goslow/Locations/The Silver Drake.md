Overseen by [Lone-Wolf Louie](../NPCs/Lone-Wolf%20Louie.md), [The Silver Drake](The%20Silver%20Drake.md) is one of the most famous [Gambler's Guild](../../../../Peoples%20&%20Factions/Gambler's%20Guild/Gambler's%20Guild.md) halls in all of Saros, 2nd only to the massive hall in Rore. The Silver Drake is a tightly ran and well secured building where the foolhardy come from all over Saros to test their luck and their coin with hopes of leaving Goslow as rich as [Lord Goldhaven](../../Pyrris/NPCs/The%20Queen's%20Council/Lord%20Goldhaven.md) himself!
