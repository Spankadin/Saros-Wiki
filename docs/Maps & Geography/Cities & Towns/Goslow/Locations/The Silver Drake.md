Overseen by [[../NPCs/Lone-Wolf Louie|Lone-Wolf Louie]], [[The Silver Drake|The Silver Drake]] is one of the most famous [[../../../../Peoples & Factions/Gambler's Guild/index|Gambler's Guild]] halls in all of Saros, 2nd only to the massive hall in Rore. The Silver Drake is a tightly ran and well secured building where the foolhardy come from all over Saros to test their luck and their coin with hopes of leaving Goslow as rich as [[../../Pyrris/NPCs/The Queen's Council/Lord Goldhaven|Lord Goldhaven]] himself!
