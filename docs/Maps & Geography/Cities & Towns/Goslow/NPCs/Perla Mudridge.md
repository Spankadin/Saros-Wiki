The owner and innkeeper of [[../Locations/The Toad|The Toad]], a tall female halfling named Perla. She was once an adventurer, but was maimed by a dragon and lost her left leg. Perla's best friend is [[./Gerdga|Gerdga]], who also happens to manage The Toad. She loves details, and she's often seen sitting at a table drinking and eagerly sharing tales with adventurers that come into The Toad (with her [[../../../../History & Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]] leg propped up on the table).

Munchil "Munchies" Muldridge, nephew of Perla, works at The Toad and wants to adventure.
(offer a seemingly benign request from perla to take it easy on him, but it turns to real danger.)
