The owner and innkeeper of [The Toad](../Locations/The%20Toad.md), a tall female halfling named Perla. She was once an adventurer, but was maimed by a dragon and lost her left leg. Perla's best friend is [Gerdga](./Gerdga.md), who also happens to manage The Toad. She loves details, and she's often seen sitting at a table drinking and eagerly sharing tales with adventurers that come into The Toad (with her [Leystone](../../../../History%20&%20Lore/Legends/Leystone.md) leg propped up on the table).

Munchil "Munchies" Muldridge, nephew of Perla, works at The Toad and wants to adventure.
(offer a seemingly benign request from perla to take it easy on him, but it turns to real danger.)
