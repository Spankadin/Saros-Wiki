Overseeing the forge is a massive man simply known as Bedford. He has a loud booming voice, a shiny bald head, and a large grey mustache. He and his wife Mary love visitors and is always cheerful. His leather overalls are covered in soot and burn marks and his hands are like chiseled steel from decades of dedicated smith-work. Though very bulky and freakishly strong, he is also a proficient artist who adorns his creations with delicate and detailed inlays. He is one of the few in [[../../../../History & Lore/A Brief Saros History|Saros]] capable of forging [[../../../../History & Lore/Legends/Leystone|Leystone]].

Bedford's wife Mary is a sweet lady with a small-town charm not often felt in busy, bustling Goslow. Mary's hobbies include raising butterflies, beekeeping, and spending most days sitting in the shade playing cards, gossiping with friends, reading "The Fine Point" gazette and drinking lemonade while Bedford works the anvil. She dreams of one day being able to draw from the "Deck of Many Things".
