Korth serves as Head Priest at The [[../Locations/Temple of Torm|Temple of Torm]]. He is a very old and wise human paladin with large white eyebrows that hide his small eyes. Fairly narcoleptic and seems to always be asleep, however locals tell of a time when he was a mighty warrior who rallied the town to victory against a massive orc raiding horde.
