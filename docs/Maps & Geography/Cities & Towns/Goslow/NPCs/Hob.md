Hob is a Water Elemental that stands 8 foot tall. He is the bouncer and servant at [[../Locations/The Toad (Tavern and Inn)|The Toad (Tavern and Inn)]] in [[../index|Goslow]]. At [[./Gerdga|Gerdga]]'s command, he sloshes through the bar, cleaning tables and kicking out unruly patrons... somehow leaving no trace of liquid behind. Hob doesn't have feelings or desires, he is simply a magical construct who is bound to The Toad, and cannot leave it's premises without turning back into plain water.
