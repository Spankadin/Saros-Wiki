The Sand [[./index|Dwarves]], split from the [[./Khaz'dar|Khaz'dar]] after [[../../History-& Lore/Events/The-Great-Betrayal|The Great Betrayal]], taking to [[../../Locations-& NPCs/Landmarks/The-Glimmering-Expanse|The Glimmering Expanse]] to seek out untold riches. Some still believe them to still be in the deserts though none know for sure, as they stopped communications and trade with other peoples of [[../../History-& Lore/A-Brief-Saros-History|Saros]] centuries ago.
