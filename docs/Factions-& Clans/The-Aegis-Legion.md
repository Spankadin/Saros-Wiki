The Aegis Legion serves as the shield and sword of the kingdom, maintaining order under the strategic command of [General Ironclad](../Locations-&%20NPCs/Cities%20&%20Towns/Pyrris/NPCs/General-Ironclad.md). They act as both a military and a local policing force. Though the Legion have garrisons in most towns, the bulk of them reside at [Grymswatch](../Locations-&%20NPCs/Cities%20&%20Towns/Grymswatch.md).

Aegis Legion's motto: "Honor, Heart, Homeland."
Aegis Legion's battle cry: "For Courage, Conquest, and Crown!"
