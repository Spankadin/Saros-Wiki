The owner of [[./The Sphinx's Spellbook|The Sphinx's Spellbook]] is a short female half-elf named Mori; a timid but extremely intelligent young woman with purple hair and alchemical tattoos all over her visible skin - except her face which is almost free of ink. Mori lives above the shop on the 2nd story with her pet penguin Chibs, who she rescued and healed after finding him alone, lost, and hurt in Bishop's Bay several years ago. Chibs wears a small magical frost rune pendant Mori made for him to keep his body chilly!
