The Sphinx's Spellbook is an extremely narrow and cramped two story building that shows it's age in cracked stonework from the overgrown roots and vines that seem to weave in and out of the entire structure. Inside the shop a dank haze fills the airâ€¦ incense and herbal smoke mix with dust from the piles of parchment stacked in every corner. A small walkway through books and potions and various knick-knacks seems treacherous, but when braved, leads to a tiny counter with a bell.

The owner of the Sphinx is a short female half-elf named [[./Mori & Chibs|Mori]]; a timid but extremely intelligent young woman with purple hair and alchemical tattoos all over her visible skin - except her face which is almost free of ink. Mori lives above the shop on the 2nd story with her pet penguin [[./Mori & Chibs|Chibs]], who she rescued and healed after finding him alone, lost, and hurt in Bishop's Bay several years ago. Chibs wears a small magical frost rune pendant Mori made for him to keep his body chilly!
